# Goal

The purpose of this project is to learn how to analyze the light curve of a star using the transit method to detect exoplanets, and distinguish true exoplanet transits from false positives created by NEBs (nearby eclipsing binaries). To accomplish this goal, [Allyson Bieryla](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~abieryla/) provided us with two datasets from 2019: one with an exoplanet, and another with a false positive. Our goal is to determine which is which.

# Transit Method Overview

The transit method for detecting exoplanets is as follows:

## Step 1: TESS Observation

[TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/) determines exoplanet candidates and predictions from data sent back to the ground.

## Step 2: Target Selection

We select targets based upon certain criteria, then send them in for observation at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory.   

## Step 3: Data Reduction and Analysis in AstroImageJ

Using AstroimageJ, we analyze the data we get from our observations, culminating in a transit lightcurve.

## Step 4: Conclusions

Based on our data analysis, we decide whether the target could still be an exoplanet candidate, or if itâ€™s a false positive.
